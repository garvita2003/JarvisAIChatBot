Jarvis is an AI-virtual assistant application, just like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. It uses the advance JavaScript Concept with the feature of converting text to speech and then using the natural language processing method to help understand Jarvis, what the client is asking for, and then providing the web search result to the user. In the future, we can add multiple features to our Jarvis virtual assistant project. This project represents the motive to understand the real-world use of the concepts.
